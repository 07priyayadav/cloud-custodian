# AWS API Files

Amazon sdk are data driven from json description files, unfortunately
they are extremely inconsistent between sdks with multiple versions of
various files in different locations, because maid exercises quite
alot of the api, this directory serves to hold unified latest versions
of various apis that maid needs to operate.

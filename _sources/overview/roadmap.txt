Roadmap
-------

We hope to integrate with CMDBs in future, so we can do Tag Value
validation. Active validation of the values provides better traceability of
resource ownership in larger shared AWS accounts. We also continue to add
support for additional AWS resources. Our long term goal is to add additional
cloud providers (e.g., Azure and Google) if there is interest.

Encrypt Extant Keys
-------------------

Will scan all keys in the bucket for unencrypted keys and by default
remediate them such that they are encrypted.

Example

    action: encrypt-keys

Options

- `crypto` for determining the crypto mechanism, this can either be `AWS:KMS` or `AES256` (default)
- `report-only` generate reports of unencrypted keys in a bucket, but do not remediate them.


Encryption Bucket Policy
------------------------

Adds a encryption required bucket policy, merging with extant policy
statements.

Example

    action: encryption-policy


Global Grants
=============

Scan buckets that allow for global (ie non capitalone) access in their
acls and report them and the acl permissions granted.

Example

    action: global-grants

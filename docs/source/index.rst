Cloud Custodian Documentation
=============================

A stateless rules engine for policy definition and
enforcement with metrics and detailed reporting across the dozens of
enterprise and lob specific policies capitalone has for aws. The goal
was rather than having dozens of tools and scripts in place with
highly variable operational controls that a unified tool and language
with consistent reporting, metrics, and operations would provide
superior control and visibility. Policies are specified for a given
resource type and constructed from a vocabulary of filters and actions
specific to a resource type.
